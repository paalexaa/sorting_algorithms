<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<p>This repository contains implementations of three basic sorting algorithms:
  <ul>
    <il>Bubble Sort</il>
    <il>Insertion Sort</il>
    <il>Selection Sort</il>
  </ul>
  Each algorithm is implemented in its own file, along with a test suite to demonstrate their functionality. 
  This project is intended for educational purposes and provides a simple comparison of different sorting techniques.
